#### Grocery Tracker

The project will use Django and existing Python scrapers to take the information of what the customer purchases from where, and suggest the more affordable choices available. Either based on real-time data, or from other customer's own purchases.

**This project is undergoing ongoing development. As new components, integrations, and documentation are completed, this section will be updated to reflect them.**

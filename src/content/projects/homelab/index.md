### Homelabbing

Homelabbing can take various forms. It can be as simple as owning a raspberry pi and managing a few hard drives, to as complex as being able to power a small country. I'm somewhere in the middle. I've opted to highlight mainly developer focused projects and redacted some projects due to privacy.


Docker used to be a foreign thing but it's strange to say I've been using it for years now because playing with my homelab never felt like work to me. Here are the main containers running that I'd like to point out.

- Nginx Proxy Manager: A great way to learn about HTTP, networking, and how docker networks play a role here
- Immich: Google Photos replacement, great to really put pressure on your back up systems because all your photos are there networking
- Portainer: was really nice in the beginning, don't really use it so much 
- Mealie: for recipes
- Navidrome: for music
- Nextcloud: for Google Drive replacement
- Some honorable mentions: Tailscale, Unifi's networking ecosystem

#### Linux Distros
- I've ran a few different distros until I found one I'm happy with: Fedora. Very stable.
- Proxmox does interest me but I've got no major complains enough for me to move over.
- For those interested, I do run Omarchy, the new cool kid on the block, on my personal laptop. Mixed opinions. 

I eventually will do a larger write up on the above when I have more time.

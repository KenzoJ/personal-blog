### Backend
- Improved overall site security and performance by upgrading Ruby from 2.5.3 to 2.7.6.
- Meticulously planned and executed the migration from Rails 5 to Rails 6.
- Built a new RSpec testing framework to begin introducing structured functional tests across the codebase

### Frontend
- Led the design and development of a new homepage and multiple landing pages.
- Collaborated with leadership to iterate on user flow and page structure.
- Implemented an enhanced front-end search experience, improving overall customer usability.
- Used Vue to control components accross the site
 
### Current focuses

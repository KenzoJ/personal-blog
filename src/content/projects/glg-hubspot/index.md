*Separated from the previous section due to the modern frameworks and ecosystem involved. These highlights focus exclusively on the developer-facing work, though there are many workflows I made that are exclusively in Hubspot.*

### Migration

- Assisted in the migration of key services into the HubSpot ecosystem.

- Led the transition from statically hosted landing pages to HubSpot’s newly launched Developer Program, moving away from HubL templates toward modern React and TypeScript based development.

### Landing Pages

- Built and integrated React components and interactive widgets to create more engaging and dynamic landing pages.

- Developed features during a period when HubSpot’s documentation was being rewritten, requiring grit and more problem-solving than what should have been necessary.

- Designed landing pages to balance developer maintainability with the marketing team’s need for flexible, content-driven customization within HubSpot.

### Backend APIs
- Currently implementing a synchronization process between HubSpot data and the existing AWS-hosted backend database

I've created websites before, a fully anonymous one, never. 

It starts off quite simple, 

1. create a website 
2. upload it to a server
3. Share

and evolves into...

- build a website with minimal security issues
- buy a domain
	- needs money for it
		- buy with crypto currency
			- learn how to buy bitcoin anonymously
				- I should probably be researching this on a VPN with a tor browser
					- install Tor
					- install VPN 


If you want to get in touch with me about something or just to say hi, reach out on social media or send me an email.
						- Paid or unpaid? need money to pay but unpaid means tracking some sort of data
	- needs address
		- use paid service that gives you address
	- needs email
		- create new mail account
- upload website to server
		- do i use my own server or is it more secure using PaaS 
	- more secure using own server
		- will do this at later point

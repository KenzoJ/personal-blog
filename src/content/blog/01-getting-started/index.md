I've created websites before, a fully anonymous one, never. 

It starts off quite simple, 

1. create a website 
2. upload it to a server
3. share

and evolves into...

- build a website with minimal security issues
- buy a domain:
	- needs money for it
		- buy with crypto currency
			- learn how to buy bitcoin anonymously
				- (realizing now) I should probably be researching this on a VPN with a tor browser
					- install Tor
					- install VPN 
						- Paid or unpaid? 
            - which is the most trustworthy VPN?
	- needs phsycial address
		- use paid service that gives you address
    - using real address gets you tracked
	- needs email
		- create new mail account
    - what IP did you create that account from?
- upload website to server
		- do i use my own server or is it more secure using PaaS 
        - I won't get into what it means to host a website on your own server

All of the above is what I found out in about a few hours of diligent work. If all roads lead to Rome, then all privacy concerns take you into onto the FBI's watchlist (kidding). There's nothing illegal I'm doing, but each step of the way takes you away from the public eye where--I'm sure you're seeing where I'm coming from--why would you need to hide your address when buying something except to escape paying taxes. 

I'm only trying to create a website that lives online that is very hard to track down to my person. There are many, many more steps I can take to hide my identity but my point is that it shouldn't take a degree in cybersecurity to want to be anonymous online. I'm sure there were many measures taken after the US deemed the internet as a Utility, as well as removing net neutrality. 

More to dig into later.

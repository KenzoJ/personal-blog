Owned and operated a small production company creating commercial content and music videos for local brands and artists. Led outreach to local businesses, produced promotional materials, and worked with clients on bringing their vision to reality. We secured a retainer contract with a local electric bike company, directed music videos for contests, and produced spec photoshoots to help show brands what we can do.

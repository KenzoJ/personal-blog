# Personal Astro Blog

A minimal personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).  
I wanted experience in a modern JS framework that uses markdown for the main content.

This is both my website to showcase personal projects and soon-to-be blog going over the following topics I'm interested in:
    Privacy
    Homelabbing
    Activism
    Capitalism
    Running an Ethical Company
    Personal rants
